NOTES TO SELF:
how to compile code manually via Git Bash

use the command "g++ (insert c cpp file here) -o (output name.exe file here)"

so far the g++ compiler is only good for c and cpp files so be cautious of that

NOTE TO SELF: multiple files
  its a little difficult to work with multiple files with g++ alone. better to use an
  IDE to make life easier but I at least tried to understand the manual way of compiling and look forward
  to learning a little more about it later
